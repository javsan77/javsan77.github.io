I’m Javier Sánchez Ayte, a backend developer with more than 10 years of experience building robust, scalable, and results-driven software solutions. I have worked with technologies such as PHP (Laravel, Drupal, CodeIgniter), Java (Spring Boot), Python, and .NET, integrating complex systems and designing APIs and services for organizations that manage large volumes of data.

Throughout my career, I’ve been involved in high-impact projects, including integrated human-resources systems, educational platforms, videoconferencing solutions, and national statistical information systems. I specialize in backend architecture, SQL Server and MySQL optimization, process automation, and the design of REST services for enterprise-level applications.

I am currently expanding my expertise into the field of Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models, developing chatbots, training pipelines, and AI-powered applications, aiming to transition into a role as an AI Backend Developer / LLM Engineer.

I’m passionate about learning, documenting knowledge, and sharing the projects I build. On this website, you’ll find selected work, personal experiments, and ongoing progress across software engineering and artificial intelligence.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
