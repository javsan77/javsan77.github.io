I am an AI Backend Developer with over 10 years of experience designing, building, and maintaining backend systems across diverse technologies — including PHP (Laravel, Drupal, CodeIgniter), Java (Spring Boot), and .NET.

Over the years, I have led the development of enterprise applications, data-driven APIs, and process automation systems for both the public and private sectors. My work is guided by a strong focus on reliability, scalability, and performance.

I am currently expanding my expertise into the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in LLM (Large Language Model) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integration. My goal is to design intelligent backend architectures that combine traditional software engineering with modern AI capabilities — enabling organizations to extract real value from their unstructured data.

I develop and experiment with Python, FastAPI, and AI frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex, working with vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone) and open-source models (LLaMA, Mistral). My public code is available at: [Visit my github account](https://github.com/javsan77).

I hold a Double Master’s Degree in Information Technology Management (Spain and Peru), and I am passionate about continuous learning, open-source collaboration, and the future of intelligent backend systems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
